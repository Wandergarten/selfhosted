# selfhosted

This repository is dedicated to all things #selfhosted. 

It's a wild, discontinuous bunch of documentation, links, and ideas. 

Probably no useful to anyone besides myself. No magic to be expected. 

## Overview
* /[hardkerneled](hardkerneled/README.md)/: first steps I took a some years ago with an Odroid XU4 (ARM-32). First and foremost usecase: media vault. Deprecated use - one of those drawer SBCs. 
* /[vault](vault/README.md)/: the one and only vault machine to rule 'em all! A powerful N200 (x86-64) passively-cooled system I planted beneath my 4K monitor. Use in progress. 
* /[yumberry](yumberry/README.md)/: placeholder repository for a coming rpi 5. Not sure what's it use case going to be. So far, just a place to collect ideas and stuff.
